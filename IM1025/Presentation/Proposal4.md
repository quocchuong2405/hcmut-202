## Must objectives

### Must be safe, legal, comply with Uni policies: Yes

You can stay anywhere you want, as long as you are exposed to many people. Not much activity, less prone to physical injury.
Exposed to outdoor environment, health concerns ahead, but avoidable.

Laws state non-authorized raffle hosts can sell tickets on site and during the event only.
The result of the raffle can be declared during the event or at a later date.
Not a problem if complied.

Uni does not forbid such activity as long as it does not disturb the surrounding people.
Acquire permission from the school, then do what you need.

### Earn at least $500: Yes

On average, each ticket generates $2 of profit, meaning at least 250 tickets or 84% of the tickets must be sold.

Supposed the Uni has at least 1,8000 students (potential buyers), 250 makes up less than 2%, hence plausible.

### Can be completed within 9 weeks: Yes

Supposed we sell tickets for 6 hours a day.
300 tickets for 1 person per day equates to 50 days, which is well less than 9 weeks.

### Opportunity to learn PM: No

Raffling is technically making paper pieces, handing them out then announce the lucky piece.

There is no managerial work throughout the process.

## Want objectives

### Earning potential: 0

The average profit per ticket is $2.
In the case we sell all of the tickets, that would generate 300 * $2 = $600.
If for some reason the last unsold ticket is also the winning ticket, we will make 299 * $3 = $897. Probability 1/300!

### Fun: 1

Basically you will be making efforts to have people buy a piece of paper. The most fun you will get is chatting with friends.

### Increase awareness of charity: 1

When people think about lottery tickets, they only care about the numbers. Maybe if a flyer is embed together with the ticket, people will read the information about the charity out of boredom.

### Resume worthy: 0

The project process is basically

- Print a bunch of papers with numbers
- Splitting up to sell, more formally known as distribute
- Announce the lucky winner via various media means

No managerial work is involved, not resume worthy unless you are applying for sales.

### Be featured on local TV news: 0

Raffle or lottery is too common of a concept that the local TV might not even bat an eye.
Selling also involves cash flows, and this is potential sensitive topic depending on the laws.
