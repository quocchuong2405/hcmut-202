## Must objectives

### Must be safe, legal, comply with Uni policies: Yes

- Little to no physical activity.
To avoid revealing strategies, teams will be separated from each another, thus avoiding fights if any.

- Laws only forbid bidding and for-profit activities.
Holding a local competition is no different from inviting friends over to play.
Absolutely legal.

- Because the big screen electronic classrooms are to be utilized, participants are enforced to comply with the University's safety and hazard regulations.

### Earn at least $500: Yes

$500 equates to at least 22 teams or 100 individuals.

Let's say we allow at most 10 persons per team.
That is 220 individuals for team play only.

Reportedly, the Uni has at least 18,000 students.
Together the figures don't even make up 2%.

Keep in mind that males like to bond up and play together, so they are very likely to invite their friends from other schools to play. Hence the calculation is extremely modest.

### Can be completed within 9 weeks: Yes

The competition is expected to take play at the weekend, meaning we have about 12 hours per day.
Each match lasts from 10 to 30 minutes, and multiple matches can happen concurrently.

Let's take 22 teams as an example. They will play according to the single elimination rule, meaning there will be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + (32 - 22) = 40 matches.
Suppose each match lasts 30 minutes and 2 matches can be carried out simultaneously. That equates to 10 hours, just enough for one day, and we can still have more than 2 matches going on at once or have matches ending sooner than 30 minutes.

Solo players play by the double elimination rule, meaning that they have another chance if they lose.
Let's say we have 100 players, and that will need at most 2 * 100 - 1 = 199 matches.
Since they are playing solo, we will not utilize the big screen but only their personal monitor, meaning that we can have more matches going parallel.
For example, we can allow 10 pairs of player at the same time. Still assuming a match lasts 30 minutes, the competition will before 10 hours.

2 days a week, 9 weeks contiguously, and we can afford over 300 matches with considerable overhead time.
In the case that too many people sign up, we always hold the right to refuse their application.

### Opportunity to learn PM: Yes

Hosting a tournament requires great PM efforts.

- Define: What, where, when
- Plan: Choose prize, find sponsor, find space, equipment, infrastructure
- Preparation: Advertisements, invitations, public relation
- Delivering: teamwork to control the pace, problem management, replacement management

## Want objectives

### Earning potential: 1

Expect 400 individuals, 100 from each year, 80% of which sign up as a team. That makes 40 8-person teams. Projected profit is $1360.

### Fun: 2

If someone decide to play Halo, they enjoy their time playing Halo. Fun is not an objective, fun is a fact.

Halo is a team-based game. The more the merrier.

### Increase awareness of charity: 2

Halo was first released in 2001, and people had good times with it.

Recognition is ascertained, and the charity can greatly benefit.

### Resume worthy: 2

Hosting a competition requires a lot of managerial work. All the way from defining, planning, executing, delivering to logistics and supply.

### Be featured on local TV news: 1

Gaming is more geared towards the younger segment.
Local TV news are more likely watched the middle aged, channels that young people watch are likely not local.
